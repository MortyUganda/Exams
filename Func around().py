# Implement a generator function that takes a single argument:

# iterable â€” an iterable object
# The function should return a generator that generates a sequence of tuples, each of which contains another element of the iterable object being iterated, as well as the previous and following elements:

# (<previous element>, <next element>, <next element>)
# For the first element, the previous value is None, for the last element, the next value is also None.
