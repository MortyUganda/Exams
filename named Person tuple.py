# A named Person tuple is available to you, which contains data about the person. The first element
# of the named tuple is the name of the person, the second is  â€” age, the third is height. A list is also available 
# persons containing these tuples.

# Complete the code below so that it
# groups people from this list according to their height and displays the resulting groups. For each group
# , the height should be indicated first, and then the names of people with
# the corresponding height should be separated by commas. The groups should be arranged in order of increasing height, each by 
# in a separate line, the names in groups are in alphabetical order, in the following format:

# <height>: <name>, <name>, ...
