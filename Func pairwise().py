# Implement a generator function that takes a single argument:

# iterable â€” an iterable object
# The function should return a generator that generates a sequence of tuples, each of which contains another element of the iterable object being iterated, as well as the next element following it:

# (<next element>, <next element>)
# For the last element, the next value is None.
